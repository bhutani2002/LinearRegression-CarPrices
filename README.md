# LinearRegression-CarPrices

Linear Regression is the supervised Machine Learning model in which the model finds the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variable i.e it finds the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable.

FOR THIS CAR DATASET, WE TRAINED 7 DIFFERENT MODELS FOR LINEAR REGRESSION PROBLEM. USING DIFFERENT USEFUL LIBRARIES AND DATA, WE CONVERTED THE DATA INTO DATAFRAME AND IMPLEMENTED "Feature Preprocessing and Engineering WITH MODEL BUILDING" AND ALSO PLOTTED HEAT MAP, DISPLOTS AND SCATTERPLOTS TO INSPECT ABOUT THE DATA. AND IN THE END,WE FOUND OUT THE ACCURACY AND mean_squared_error FOR EVERY MODEL AND THE BEST ACCURACY CAME OUT FOR THE RandomForestRegressor() MODEL(ACCURACY- 93.87%).
